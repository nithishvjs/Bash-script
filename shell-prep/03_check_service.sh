By default, awk don't consider spaces/tabs on between the words.so, when even there is an 10 spaces have between words one and two in the file, and if we use {print 2 } it takes word two rather than spaces

2> /dev/null : It outputs only message and if it have any errors on the output, it doesnt print the output outside.

(when we run scripts without 2>/dev/null,

If the service doesnâ€™t exist or fails, you'll see an error.

[Unit xyz.service could not be found.]

That error message will show up in the terminal and could break scripts.)
